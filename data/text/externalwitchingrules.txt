In this episode[;] you can switch between 3 different
spellbooks using a special card in your 4th spell slot.

You also start with 4 dice and your limit is stronger.
But[;] you don't have a prepared spell slot

Your starter spells are [yellow]Cauldron[] and [yellow]Infliction[] in book 1[;]
[yellow]Magic_Shield[] and [yellow]Magic_Missile[] in book 2[;] and
[yellow]Duplicate[] and [yellow]Hall_of_Mirrors[] in book 3.

That's all. Good luck there!
