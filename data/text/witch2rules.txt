h1|A Wizardly Mix-Up

In this episode, all of your equipment requires a specific dice.
The dice required is based on the location of the equipment
in the "Equipped" section, like so:

1/3/5
2/4/6

Equipment with two or three slots will take a combination of dice which is preserved between turns.

If your equipment upgrades by changing its slots to other dice, it'll take even dice
if placed in slots 2, 4, or 6, and odd dice if in slots 1, 3, or 5.
