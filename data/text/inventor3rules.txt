h1|Equipment Guard

Another twist on the durability system!

This time, the enemies break your equipment instead.
You'll have to figure out ways to either avoid damage
or break your equipment properly in order to get by.

As usual, equipment that breaks will become a gadget.
Also, you start with half health. You've got shields, after all.
