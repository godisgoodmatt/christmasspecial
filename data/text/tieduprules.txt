In this episode you have only 3 moves[;] then your turn ends
wether you want it to or not.

Don't worry your spellbook doesn't count as a move so you don't need to worry
about placing spells in your slots or throwing dice!

Finally your limit break is an extra turn
Seeing as you only have 3 moves per turn its pretty fair!

Thanks for playing this episode! [heart]
