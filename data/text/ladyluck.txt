h1|A Twist of Fate

Hey, Lady Luck! Now you're in our shoes!

Each turn, your items change, and if you follow the
commandments on your skillcard, you receive a bonus effect.

The only item you can keep is your skillcard.
When you get new items, only equip 1 at a time!

Good luck! Not from me, of course.
