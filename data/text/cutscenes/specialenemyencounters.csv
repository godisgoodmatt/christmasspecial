Beatrice,1,Well[;] if it isn't another dice!||Or wait[;] if it's only one of you[;]|is it 'douse'?|That sounds right. Anyway[;] welcome|to defeat[;] douse.,
Beatrice,2,Welcome to the end of your journey!|Prepare to douse!,
Beatrice,3,Hey[;] I looked it up and apparently 'douse' ISN'T the|singular of dice after all!||In modern usage 'dice' is both singular|and plural. Isn't that sweet!||Now: prepare to dice.,

Beatrice,6,Oh hello there! I've been thinking about what to|say if you turned up again.||I was workshopping something around 'DICE-truction'[;]|but then I got bored of thinking about you.,
Beatrice,7,You again! You might trick me once[;] but I|won't let you trick me[;] dice.,
Beatrice,8,Welcome back[;] sweetie. Time to dice with death?|Hmm[;] no[;] just time to death some dice I think.,

Drake,1,Yeah okay then[;] let's fight. I told everyone to go easy on you[;]|you know[;] I wanted to take you out myself.,
Drake,2,I've got to fight a walking dice?||I'm FOUR HUNDRED and SEVENTY SIX years old.||This is entirely beneath my dignity. But|I guess let's get it over with.,
Drake,3,I can smell something. Have you been eating garlic?||It doesn't count if you win and|you've been eating garlic!,

Scathach,3,The ethereal echoes of the cave speak to me of|your future[;] and they say:||You're about to die.,
Scathach,4,As fall the distant stars in the clear night sky[;]|so fall you in[;] you know...||...this fight that I'm about to beat you in.,
Scathach,5,When the dungeons deep beneath the earth|lie empty[;] and the moonlight shines into their|hollowed-out spaces...|...still will you be trapped here losing all|your fights like a loser.,
Scathach,6,Hey[;] I heard that eternity's blank eyes will see you|fall and falter and fall again. Starting now.,
