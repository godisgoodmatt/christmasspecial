h1|The Cycle of Life

The Jester no longer has a deck[;] and now
they're exactly like everyone else!

...Except equipment is now part of a "cycle"[;]
and has to be used in a random order each turn.

To compensate[;] you have more dice than normal[;] and
a "Cycle" skillcard that lets you advance the cycle.
