In this episode, your equipment's a bit prone to
falling into disrepair. You're going to have to
use your equipment at least once each turn
in order to prevent it from losing durability.

However, you now roll dice with the Robot's CPU counter.
All equipment that breaks get scrapped into gadgets.
Rolling a Jackpot now allows you to use these gadgets.
