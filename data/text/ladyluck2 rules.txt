h1|Anti-Cheat

Hey, Lady Luck! I'm shocked at you, honestly. Cheating?
We both know that's completely out of character for you.

You remember how you being a dice works, right?
Each turn, your items change, and the items
you equip become your skillcard. Remember to
only equip one at a time!

We've done away with the commandments, though.
Instead, every six that you don't use by
the end of your turn deals 5 damage to you.

Of course, as long as you don't cheat, you won't have
that many sixes, right? And we both know you never cheat.
