h1|Christmas Spirit

On odd turns[;] you steal a copy of an enemy equipment[;]
just like you normally do. The equipment you steal stays
for two turns[;] until you steal another equipment.

On even turns[;] however[;] the enemy steals a copy of
*your* equipment[;] and gets to keep it until they steal
another equipment from you.

Isn't sharing fun?
